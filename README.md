### Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer or server to be divided into multiple virtual machines, or "VMs". These VMs can then run different operating systems or applications while sharing the resources of the host machine.\

### Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a software, firmware, or hardware component that allows a single physical machine to run multiple virtual machines (VMs).\

### Scalability

Scalability in Cloud Computing refers to the ability of a cloud system to handle increasing or decreasing workloads efficiently. It allows resources such as processing power, storage, and network bandwidth to expand or contract dynamically based on demand.\
This flexibility ensures that businesses can scale up during peak usage periods and scale down during low-demand times, optimizing costs and maintaining performance. Cloud providers offer two types of scalability:

**Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)**: Increases the capacity of existing hardware by adding more power (e.g., upgrading to a more powerful server).

**Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)**: Involves adding more servers or nodes to distribute the load, which is often preferred for handling high-demand workloads.

*Scalability is a core advantage of cloud computing, enabling businesses to grow without the need for massive upfront infrastructure investments.*
