# Cloud Storage Types

The main types of cloud storage are object, file, and block storage:

**Object storage**\
Pairs data with unique identifiers called metadata. Objects are uncompressed and unencrypted, so they can be accessed quickly at scale.

**File storage**\
Organizes data and represents it to users. It has a hierarchical structure that makes it easy to navigate data, but it also increases processing time.

**Block storage**\
Splits a storage volume into individual instances called blocks. It's a fast storage system with low latency, making it ideal for high performance workloads.

**Object storage**\
Organizations have to store a massive and growing amount of unstructured data, such as photos, videos, machine learning (ML), sensor data, audio files, and other types of web content, and finding scalable, efficient, and affordable ways to store them can be a challenge. Object storage is a data storage architecture for large stores of unstructured data. Objects store data in the format it arrives in and makes it possible to customize metadata in ways that make the data easier to access and analyze. Instead of being organized in files or folder hierarchies, objects are kept in secure buckets that deliver virtually unlimited scalability. It is also less costly to store large data volumes.\
Applications developed in the cloud often take advantage of the vast scalability and metadata characteristics of object storage. Object storage solutions are ideal for building modern applications from scratch that require scale and flexibility, and can also be used to import existing data stores for analytics, backup, or archive.

**File storage**\
File-based storage or file storage is widely used among applications and stores data in a hierarchical folder and file format. This type of storage is often known as a network-attached storage (NAS) server with common file level protocols of Server Message Block (SMB) used in Windows instances and Network File System (NFS) found in Linux.

**Block storage**\
Enterprise applications like databases or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems often require dedicated, low-latency storage for each host. This is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a storage area network (SAN). In this case, you can use a cloud storage service that stores data in the form of blocks. Each block has its own unique identifier for quick storage and retrieval.
