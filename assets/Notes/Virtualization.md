# Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer or server to be divided into multiple virtual machines, or "VMs". These VMs can then run different operating systems or applications while sharing the resources of the host machine.

Virtualization can help businesses use their hardware more efficiently, and can also power cloud computing services. Some benefits of virtualization include: 
- **Improved scalability**: Virtualization can help improve scalability and workloads. 
- **Reduced infrastructure costs**: Virtualization can result in the use of fewer servers, which can reduce infrastructure costs and maintenance. 
- **Reduced energy consumption**: Virtualization can help reduce energy consumption. 
- **Access to a larger app library**: Enabling virtualization on a Windows device can give you access to a larger library of apps.

There are several different types of virtualization, including: 
- **Desktop virtualization**: Allows a centralized server to manage and deliver individualized desktops. 
- **Network virtualization**: Splits network bandwidth into independent channels that can be assigned to specific devices or servers. 
- **Software virtualization**: Separates applications from the operating system and hardware. 
- **Data virtualization**: Allows companies to manage data by bringing together data from multiple sources.
